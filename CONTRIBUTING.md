## Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to our project. Your efforts and contributions make this project thrive and evolve. Whether you're reporting a bug, proposing a new feature, or writing documentation, your participation is immensely valued.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open-source project. In return, they will reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Types of Contributions

We are open to various forms of contributions, including but not limited to improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials. Here are some ways you can contribute:

- Reporting bugs or issues
- Suggesting enhancements or new features
- Improving documentation or examples
- Submitting pull requests to resolve issues or add features

## Ground Rules

### Expectations

- Respect the time and effort of contributors and maintainers
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change
- Discuss significant changes via issues before proceeding with development
- Adhere to the coding standards outlined in [dev-guidelines.md](dev-guidelines.md)
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse contributions

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues tagged with "good first issue" or "help wanted," which are great starting points for your first contributions.

### Never contributed to open source before?

Here are a couple of friendly tutorials to help you get started:
- [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
- [First Timers Only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

## Getting Started

1. **Use Issue Templates:** When creating a new issue, please use the appropriate issue template:
   - Feature template for new features
   - Bug template for reporting bugs
   - Question template for inquiries

2. **Follow Conventional Commits:** Ensure your commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard.

3. **Make Atomic Commits:** Each commit should represent a single feature or fix, affecting the fewest files possible.

4. **Pull Requests:** Submit pull requests against the `develop` branch. PRs against other branches may be rejected.

5. **Adhere to Development Guidelines:** Follow the coding standards and practices outlined in [dev-guidelines.md](dev-guidelines.md).

## How to Report a Bug

**Security Disclosures:** If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to our security team instead of opening a public issue.

When reporting a bug, include as much information as possible about:
- Your environment (OS, software versions)
- Steps to reproduce the bug
- Expected behavior vs. actual behavior

## How to Suggest a Feature or Enhancement

If you have ideas for how to improve the project, open an issue describing:
- The proposed feature
- Why it's needed
- How it should work

## Code Review Process

Our team regularly reviews pull requests and provides feedback. We aim to process contributions quickly, but response times may vary based on the current workload.

### How to Write a Pull Request

When writing a pull request, make sure to:
- Clearly describe the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- Provide a concise title that follows the conventional commit rules.
- Include screenshots or animated GIFs in your pull request whenever visual changes are involved.
- Follow the [dev-guidelines.md](dev-guidelines.md) for coding standards.

### Our Code Review Process

The core team reviews Pull Requests on a regular basis. We aim to provide feedback within a week. After feedback has been given, we expect responses within two weeks. If the pull request shows no activity, we may close it.

## Code, Commit Message, and Labeling Conventions

### Code Style

Your code must adhere to the coding conventions outlined in [dev-guidelines.md](dev-guidelines.md).

### Commit Messages

Commit messages must follow the conventional commit rules, providing a clear description of the change and its impact on the project.

### Labeling Issues

Use the issue templates provided and label your issues accordingly, helping maintainers to categorize and prioritize the work efficiently.
